## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- For the background image I first went too complicated. I was trying to use a psuedo class and positioning. Just setting a background image with no-repeat did the trick very simply!
